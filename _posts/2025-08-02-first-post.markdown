Welcome to the new site.

I've been thinking about having a proper home for my writing and photography for a while now. Social media is great for quick thoughts and conversations, but some ideas need more space to breathe.

This is that space.

You'll find my longer-form writing here, along with photography and thoughts that don't fit neatly into a tweet or Instagram post. I'm also planning to share more behind-the-scenes content about my creative process.

If you want more regular updates, I'm still writing my weekly newsletter on [Substack](your-substack-link). That's where I share more personal reflections and works-in-progress.

Thanks for being here from the beginning. Let's see where this goes.
