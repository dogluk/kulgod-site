How should we distinguish science from pseudoscience?

While seemingly easy to answer, the question has flummoxed western philosophers of science dating back all the way to Aristotle, although the first documented use of 'pseudoscience' was made only in the late 18th century to refer to alchemy1. Aptly known as the demarcation problem, Karl Popper described it as the “key to most of the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science”2. The difficulty of the problem has been thought to lie not in what fields constitute pseudoscience (think astrology and homeopathy), but in what criteria to use to make such a distinction, a telling clue that there is likely still much to be worked out.

Unlike your average philosophical quandary whose esotericism confines its real-world implications to the armchair and the lecture hall, the demarcation problem has some weighty high stake implications for individuals and broader society. This has never been clearer in the past year under the throes of the pandemic — from the contested origins of the virus and the brouhaha over the utility of masks to the endorsement of outlandish cures and a burgeoning anti-vax movement — the lines between science and pseudoscience have come under increasing scrutiny and strain, only made worse by the proliferation of runaway echo chambers and filter bubbles that the algorithmic cyberspace we increasingly dwell in is designed to spawn.

Underlying the problem is the fundamental question of “how to determine which beliefs are epistemically warranted”3. Science purports to offer a compelling answer by allowing its practitioners to separate the wheat from the chaff and tell fact from fiction. It has, with little doubt, been tremendously successful at doing so. Yet, while several accounts of science's epistemic framework have been offered, such as Popper's notion of 'falsifiability', no comprehensive definition of what it really is exists. This is because science is heterogenous and constantly evolving and changing, which makes a timeless definition next to impossible. Thus, the boundaries between science and pseudoscience remain embroiled in mist.

No field encapsulates the treacherous nature of the demarcation problem better than the realm of psychedelics. Folk beliefs that run counter to what is considered scientific fact — chakras, telepathy, synchronicity — have a rich history of being associated with psychedelics, exemplified by the intertwined nature of many New Age style beliefs with psychedelic counterculture. This infamous predilection for 'wooey' beliefs amongst psychedelic users prompted Robin Carhart-Harris and Karl Friston to devote an entire section - 'What to do about the woo?' - in their highly influential paper 'REBUS and the Anarchic Brain'. They posit that the 'ontological shock' caused by psychedelics — where the influx of new information and emotion causes one to question everything one once knew — can often lead to an escapist defense that masquerades as awakening and led to bizarre beliefs or poorly understood platitudes in order to explain away uncertainty.

Even more interesting, however, is the entangling of the scientific community investigating psychedelics with ideas and concepts that many would consider defy or subvert the traditional norms of science. Since the 1960's, the phrase 'mystical experience'4, has been common parlance among scientists to refer to the profound peak experience that many people have on high psychedelic doses. 'Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance' was the title of the seminal 2006 paper by Hopkins researchers that has been cited over a thousand times and arguably launched the psychedelic renaissance. This paper, and many others that followed it, use the 'Mystical Experience Questionnaire' — a well validated psychometric tool that operationalises the concept of a mystical experience by measuring the participant’s felt sense of unity, timelessness, sacredness, paradoxicality and ineffability.

While the MEQ has proven to possess predictive utility for ascertaining therapeutic outcomes, its usage has been criticised as creating a 'black box' mentality that casts certain aspects of experience as out of bounds for scientific inquiry. In a recent opinion piece for ACS Pharmacology titled 'Moving past mysticism in psychedelic science', Sanders & Zijlmans argue that the "terminology and conceptualisation scientists use in their research should not imply that a psychedelic experience holds a special status of inaccessibility beyond other kinds of experience. To assume this special status a priori is unscientifically pessimistic" [emphasis mine].

A similar argument of 'psychedelic exceptionalism' was made in a different opinion piece by Matthew Johnson, who observed there was an "inclination to believe that the nature of the experiences people have on psychedelics are so sacred or important that the normal rules do not apply, be they the rules governing clinical boundaries, the practice of clinical psychology or medicine, sound philosophy of science, or ethics."

Does the central role of the mystical experience in psychedelic science threaten to bleed into the pseudoscientific? This cuts to the heart of the demarcation problem in psychedelics and reveals the inherent tensions of investigating phenomenal consciousness within the current metaphysical framework of western science. The tension boils down to essentially this - How do we objectively evaluate from the outside what is inherently subjective on the inside?

Of course, investigations into consciousness have long preceded modern psychedelic science and have occupied philosophers across the world for millennia, with Indian and Buddhist philosophers particularly notable for their devising of systematic and extensive methodologies to probe the inner realm of mind. But the study of consciousness was essentially ignored in the West, primarily to protect science from the Church, as famously articulated by Descartes who described the domain of science to explicitly be only about the material world (res extensa), while mental phenomena (res cogitans) was deemed to be under the purview of religion. Thus, the very conceptualisation of western science (which is now global science) made the so-called 'hard problem of consciousness' inevitable.

Recently however, consciousness has emerged back into mainstream cognitive science. One prominent approach to tackle the 'hardness' of consciousness has been neurophenomenology, made concrete in the 1990’s by the prolific cognitive scientist Francisco Varela. Neurophenomenology emphasises the importance of the irreducible nature of conscious experience and suggests complementing extensive third person 'neuro' centric methods with robust first person phenomenological approaches (such as those pioneered by Buddhist meditators). While such an approach is proving to be fruitful in laying out a path forward, the psychedelic experience still poses various challenges. For instance, how does one investigate the phenomenal nature of an experience if it is by nature ineffable?

This article began with a seemingly simple yet unanswered question 'How do we distinguish science from pseudoscience?' and in lieu of any answer, we seem to have been left with even more questions. Yet, rather than cause for despair, the seemingly intractable nature of the demarcation problem, in psychedelics and in general, may potentially be cause for optimism. Thomas Kuhn, the philosopher and author of the influential 1962 work 'The Structure of Scientific Revolution', proposed that it was only in 'normal science', which took place between moments of scientific revolution, that we find the characteristics by which science can be distinguished from other activities5. The misty and mystical terrain of the psychedelic landscape might be an important sign that we are on the cusp of a major scientific revolution.

"To say that there is more to reality than physics can account for is not a piece of mysticism: it is an acknowledgement that we are nowhere near a theory of everything, and that science will have to expand to accommodate facts of a kind fundamentally different from those that physics is designed to explain" - Thomas Nagel

"As historically constituted personalities, we may indeed reside in the prison-house of language. But all manner of sunbeams and birdsong and gut hunches leak through the barred windows of our talk. These phenomena not only touch us but perturb our language as well, even as those languages possess us at least as much as we possess them. The world is full of constructions, but it is full of encounters too, and the vibrant margins wherein we meet these Others shape and sometimes shatter those languages, concepts, and identities that, equally inevitably, map and manufacture the frameworks within which we make do.”

I turned 21 on the 21st of January 2021, at a Vipassana center amidst austere farmland in the outskirts of Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh. Teetering on the verge of leaving, I found myself trudging towards the post-tea meditation session with a dull sense of doom. Why the tread of dread? I was helplessly anticipating the inevitable appearance of a sharp and throbbing pain in my knee that had been tormenting me since the second day of the retreat.

Minutes into the sit, I had my first glimpse of the mystical as my conscious awareness embarked on a brief foray into a pure white light. The immersion eroded the traditional subject-object dichotomy of my corporeal self and I was bathed in a profound feeling of awe that left me distanced from the pain and evaporated my notions of flight.

My experience was a textbook example of a mystical experience, infused with the four hallmarks of ineffability, noetic quality, transiency and passivity, as described by William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience. I received the experience without an active intention to seek it and it lasted for about half an hour. It had an illuminative quality that afforded "insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect" (James, 1902, p. 295). Finally, though I have attempted to provide a sketch, the true nature of the experience was ineffable — it defies expression.

Textbook indeed.

The timing of the experience was also remarkable. It occurred exactly when I most desperately needed it, a cosmic birthday gift that ensured I stayed for the entirety of the retreat, a 10 day affair I had envisioned (rather grandiosely I will admit) as a rite-of-passage into adulthood. It was all quite beautifully, absurdly, poetically perfect.

Too perfect.

If I didn't know better, this would present as a nice piece of fiction. Except I do know better, it's completely true.

Perhaps, as the 'collector of coincidences' Charles Fort would say - there is only “the hyphenated state of truth-fiction” (Kripal, 2010, p. 98).

I narrate this story because I believe it contains the seed of a generative paradoxical loop that informs and mediates the complex relationship of consciousness and language. In this essay, I will gamely interrogate the nature of this loop by focusing on Erik Davis' brilliant and evocative quote from High Weirdness on the 'prison-house of language' and attempting to relate it to my own experience (Davis, 2019, p. 26).

"As historically constituted personalities, we may indeed reside in the prison-house of language.”

Davis begins with an acknowledgement of the constructivist nature of our experience. In a way, this is a Whorfian stance, that posits that our ability to make sense of the world's "kaleidoscopic flux of impressions" is largely (if not wholly) reliant on the organization of "the linguistic system in our minds" (Kay & Kempton, 1984). Our expectations become our experience.

“But all manner of sunbeams and birdsong and gut hunches leak through the barred windows of our talk.”

But it's always either a Yes, and or a Yes, but.

Davis sublimely notes how experience can become and change and shatter our expectations. No matter how tightly wound the bars, light and song and the intangible will find a way. In other words, there will always be experiences - embodied experiences - that elude our symbolic alchemy — states of being that have no way of being condensed. As James says elegantly "One must have musical ears to know the value of a symphony; one must have been in love one’s self to understand a lover’s state of mind" (James, 1902, p. 295). Love, music, the visceral intuition borne by the gut, it is precisely these raw felt experiences that remain embalmed in impenetrable qualia that form the moats that breach our expectation-cloaked Beings. The mystical will illuminate and the weird will find its way out of the box and into the mind through the conduits of our living, breathing, loving bodies.

“These phenomena not only touch us but perturb our language as well, even as those languages possess us at least as much as we possess them.”

So goes the generative paradoxical loop of experience-expectation.

Yes, our languages are the enclosures of all our meaning.

And, our embodied meaning is what forges our languages and symbols.

“The world is full of constructions, but it is full of encounters too, and the vibrant margins wherein we meet these Others shape and sometimes shatter those languages, concepts, and identities that, equally inevitably, map and manufacture the frameworks within which we make do."

By trying to describe my meditative mystical experience, I not only rendered an effable version of the ineffable, but in some sense contributed to the very existence of an ontology of the ineffable. This, Jeff Kripal might say, is explained by the paranormal event not simply being a physical event but also being a meaning event and that it involves "the irruption of meaning in the physical world via the radical collapse of the subject-object structure itself"  (Kripal, 2010, p. 25).

The expectation-experience loop flows both ways.

What is the sound of one hand clapping in a forest with no one around to hear?

The loopy nature of reality need not send us into a spiral. As long as we refuse to stodgily stand rooted in dogmatic belief and avoid the desperate grasping for explanations, and instead choose to embrace radical acceptance and relish in acts of defiant expression, we remain anchored to our emancipatory agency. This is because of the metaphysical potency of expression that lies, as Kripal notes, in its unique epistemology of being "a self-conscious knowing that recognizes its own construction and its own relativity and so opens itself up to further evolution" (Kripal, 2010, p. 116).

To let go and then to emerge.

Through the process of passively accepting mystical gifts and actively expressing creative riffs, we can twist, break, or subvert the cage of the experience-expectation loop. Our concepts and identities no longer remain shackled to a mindless self-reinforcing process of input-output-input but instead are bared open to the vagaries of our qualia-drenched existence in an embodied Self-evolving action of revelation-expression.

Harkening back to Nietzsche's account in Thus Spake Zarathustra of the human condition as a taut rope stretched between the ape of the past and the Superman of the future (Nietzsche, 2001), Davis notes the striking similarity of Nietzsche's "spiritual acrobats" or "philosophers of the future" and modernity's 'psychonauts'. (Davis, 2019, p. 35) Davis ascribes a common ground between these "spiritual acrobats" and 'psychonauts' to be their creative ability to play with gravity and create novel meaning without the need for foundations – through acts of groundless affirmation in the face of transience and fragility.

The surfing of altered states coupled with the Self-creating reflexive gain of the experience-expectation loop seems to allow us to realize Fort's rousing call of ceasing to be "written by the paranormal" and instead to "become our own authors of the paranormal" so we "can expand." (Kripal, 2010, p. 143)

This has all been well and good. However, it would be wise to end with this line from the Kena Upanishad (Olivelle, 1998)—

"which one cannot express by speech

by which speech itself is expressed

learn that that alone is brahman

and not what they here venerate"

charlie 777 is everything they say and more. it is a beautiful rich gut-wrenching paean to the human canine bond. move aside hachiko and marley and me, we have a new dog on the block.

and yet I can't help be that guy and note that since the movie the demand for labradors has increased. despite the plot of charlie revolving around a lab dying of cancer caused by inbreeding driven by demand.

something about this just guts me. that you can have this beautiful meaningful work of art with a message and the actual impact in the non-diegetic ~real world just gives the finger to that message.

it feels like no matter how moving an experience of art, the spectacle of society — the cruelty of human whims mass organized in the machinations of markets — will remain unmoved.

I say this as our cocker spaniel pups turn 1 today. we intentionally had mother lily become pregnant because female dogs have a higher chance of developing pyometra, a uterine infection, if they never give birth. we knew this because this is how we lost our 9yr old dalmatian ruby.

mother lily died tomorrow night a year ago from a pregnancy that never ended. with two pups lodged in her gasping womb she bleeded black death fluid as vets untrained in canine caesarean only recommended oxytocin to further her helpless contractions.

that night after yet another helpless heave on the dew laden lawn she padded towards the bathroom where the five pups lay. she gave them a look and a sniff and then gazed right into my eyes through my soul and hers and back. she died a few hours later as dawn was given a new lease.

like nagel's bat, we can never know what it is like to be a dog. we may coat them in sapien qualia and brush them with anthropomorphization but their Umwelt will remain unbridged.

yet her gaze that june night was a moat-light that broke through.

a close friend said I striked them as someone who was always optimistic and asked why that was so. i don't know how much longer that question can hold true. this timeline increasingly seems too dark for our hominid selves to rise up to the momentous challenge of resisting the seemingly inevitable entropic decay of annihilation, much caused by our own unknowing unblinking paths.

i must end on an uplighting redeeming note? maybe charlie causes some to 'buy' a lab. but maybe it also leads many more to stop and gaze into the eyes of the dog on the street and truly see her.

maybe the moat-light isn't born only in death and lives on when we choose to look.

maybe this is just another fiction we tell our kids so they (and we) can sleep at night.

maybe truth and fiction are two sides of a hyphaen-coin tossed only in belief.

Timeline
The first published account of canine medical intuition dates back to 1989, where two London doctors Hywel Williams1 and Andres Pembroke relate the curious anecdote of a woman learning about her malignant tumour from the incessant pawing of her dog. From their <300 word piece titled ‘Sniffer dogs in the melanoma clinic’ published in the Lancet -

The patient first became aware of the lesion because her dog (a cross between a border collie and a doberman) would constantly sniff at it. The dog (a bitch) showed no interest in the other moles on the patient’s body but frequently spent several minutes a day sniffing intently at the lesion, even through the patient’s trousers. As a consequence the patient became increasingly suspicious. This ritual continued for several months and culminated in the dog trying to bite off the lesion when the patient wore shorts. This prompted the patient to seek further medical advice. This dog may have saved her owner’s life by prompting her to seek treatment when the lesion was still at a thin and curable stage.

The authors trot out a hypothesis that malignant tumours and their “aberrant protein synthesis emit unique odours which, though undetectable to man, are easily detected by dogs”. In other words, dogs can sniff out the stench of cancer.

Four years later, the letter happened upon a dermatologist in Florida by the name of Armand Cognetta, who had been rueing that 1 in 5 melanomas went undetected. He decided to set out to work with veteran K-9 trainer Duane Pickel and his schnauzer George to see if a dog could be trained to detect melanomas. George’s training began by searching for test tubes with melanoma samples hidden around the house, progressed to identifying the right tube amongst 10 holes in a cardboard box, and ultimately to samples hidden under bandages on a willing nurse’s body. George’s capabilities were then ad-hoc tested with a grand total of 7 patients who were suspected, but not confirmed, to have melanoma and identified cancer in four, possibly five, depending on how you go about the tricky business of evaluating what is the ground truth. Hywel and John Church2 relayed George’s exploits and another anecdote of melanoma sniffing in yet another letter to the Lancet ‘Another sniffer dog for the clinic?’ in 2001.

It was finally in 2004, 15 years after the first Lancet letter and 18 years ago, that disease detection dogs officially marked itself as a scientific field of inquiry and the ‘dog scan’ was put under the experimental scanner. A team of UK doctors investigated the bladder cancer sniffing abilities of 6 dogs and how well they did compared to chance in identifying which of 7 samples contained a cancer sample (expected value of 1/7 - 14%). After 7 months of training, the dogs achieved a mean performance of 41%, selecting the right sample on 22/54 occasions. While this wasn’t the exemplary performance one would hope for (and which would soon follow), it was striking evidence that something was indeed apaw.

Pounce of Nuance
A quick note on terminology. Canine medical intuition comes in two breeds - biomedical detection dogs and medical assistance dogs. Biomedical dogs detect the presence of disease by either directly smelling the presence of an infective agent (virus/bacteria/helminth) or more commonly, by identifying changes in the volatilome (more on that later). Medical assistance dogs learn to identify changes in either smell, behaviour, or other mysterious processes, in individuals with diabetes or epilepsy (and other rarer conditions), and warn their human guardians of an imminent hypoglycemic episode/epileptic seizure.

State-of-the-bark
Since then, canine diagnosis has been tested in at least 16 different types of diseases in humans, animals, and even trees. A handy table from a paper published in 2021 summarizes twenty papers that investigated dognosis and included sensitivity and specificity (frustratingly the table displays no discernable order) -


Dognosis saw a meteoric rise with the arrival of the pandemic times. The same paper summarizes the twenty-two papers that used double blind randomised controlled trials to assess the efficacy of dognosis for covid19 -


Something the tables don’t include that is worth pointing out is that the vast majority of studies (likely all though I didn’t check every one) had very few dogs involved - in the single-digits.

The proliferation of scientific studies has occurred alongside the rise of commercial and non-profit organizations deploying dognosis in the real world. Medical Detection Dogs in the UK is the top dog with £4M+ in funds that has ongoing studies in Covid19, prostate cancer, Parkinson’s and malaria, among others, as well as training diabetes and epilepsy alert dogs. Cancer Dogs in Canada are testing firefighters for lung cancer in over a 100 departments in the United States. Dognosis was deployed in countries other than the 13 mentioned in the Covid table, including by the Indian army, Thailand, and Rwanda. Unsurprisingly, numerous reports wagged their way into the press over the past few years - including pieces in the New York Times, WIRED, Nature and The Scientist.

Dognosis By Dog Noses
The hypothesis offered by Williams and Pembroke in 1989 that dogs are smelling out disease has since been formalized. In a way, the stench of disease is by no means a modern theory, dating back to Hippocrates in 400 BC who used the art of smell to diagnose ailments. Indeed, the miasma theory of disease, that predominated before germ theory took over, went too far and reversed the causality in claiming odours caused diseases.

Our current understanding goes something like this. Every organism undergoes cellular metabolic processes that produce molecular by-products. Some of these by-products are low molecular weight compounds that exit the body via the air, skin, blood, or liquid/solid waste products. These volatile organic compounds (VOC) are collectively called the volatilome and changes in a disease-contingent manner. With their remarkable olfactory acuity, dogs are capable of detecting these shifts and can be trained to identify them across individuals.

In the studies reviewed above, disease detection dogs generally underwent a training and a test phase that involved positive reinforcement and clicker shaping to train dogs to learn to identify target volatilomes and indicate their presence to handlers using behavioral cues such as staring, sitting, or pressing their snout against the odor container. More recent studies have moved far beyond hiding cancer test tubes around the house and use training aids such as the German ‘Detection Dog Training System’ (DDTS) by Kynoscience that automates the training process for around $17,000.

Nosey Machines
The success of dognosis of cancer prompted researchers to look for uncanine ways to detect cancer VOCs, with a 2010 Nature paper finding some success using nanosensors. More recently, an ongoing collaborative effort between MIT and Medical Detection Dogs and others, are working to develop an electronic nose (eNose) that rivals the capabilities of dognosis. In a paper published in September 2021, dognosis was leveraged to train an Artificial Neural Net on data from a gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and microbiota analysis of urine samples from prostate cancer individuals. The results were interesting and worth diving into in a whole other piece but the punchline was -

it appears that no unique (set of) molecule(s) can be found as unambiguous biomarkers and instead it is the scent character, as opposed to the molecular composition of scent that communicates the cancer signature to canines. GC-MS produces a list of VOCs that carry the information for each experimental case but such lists themselves unfortunately do not generalize to provide a “master biomarker template” in the form of molecular species identifications and concentrations

Parting Barks
Medicine is essentially two things - diagnosis (prediction) and treatment (causal inference). 3


To me, one of the most fascinating aspects of canine medical intuition is the fundamental questions it raises about the nature of medical diagnoses.4

This is best illustrated by the the UAE study (n=3290) that performed a Bayesian latent analysis model to compare the efficacy of dognosis vs RT-PCR. They found that dognosis was actually more sensitive than the ostensible gold-standard RT-PCR, which was being used in all the other studies and real-world settings to validate the ‘ground truth’ on which to gauge the accuracy of dognosis.

Difficulties in standardization and regulation, cost of training, lack of anonymization and the infrastructure needed to care for canines are commonly cited reasons for why dognosis is impractical on a mass-scale. A big part of the challenge is the black-box nature of dognosis that provokes incredulity and the ‘can-we-really-trust-a-dog-to-tell-someone-they-have-cancer’ disbelief that forestalls wide-spread adoption.

The current popular approach appears to avoid depending directly on the carbon-based black-box dognosis and adopt silicon-based ‘we-totally-understanding-how-large-neural-nets-work’ eNoses instead. One can potentially imagine another approach that synergistically combines carbon and silicon in a manner that augments both. It remains to be actualized what this would look like. Until then, we’re stuck with good ol’ unfurry diagnoses.

PORTIA in MoV, Act 1 Scene 2 :

“If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching “

-

Sleep before 12, Alarm at 8. Phone kept such that I am forced to get out of bed. Never snooze.

Run or do some form of exercise within the hour of waking up. 30 pushups count.

Shower, Meditate, Coffee.

Physically transition from abode to Place of Work

Ensure workspace has - good wifi, well positioned charging point, water and washroom, close to light but filling food.

Ensure you don’t reach levels of hunger that are palpable

Take breaks that don’t involve crass stimulation - i.e. no twitter, newsletter, insta. Considered messages, books, staring into space - ok.

Always try to schedule meetings the day before, not the day off. Try to keep meetings either at the start or at the end of the day.

Stop working once you notice yourself being seriously distracted + unable to pay attention

Force yourself to be active in learning - solve problem sets, actually write code, organize information in new ways

Did we mention food already? Ffs, eating sufficient food is crucial. Eat a big breakfast, drink smoothies, eat sandwiches, plenty of nuts, crackers, hummus, light BUT filling lunch. Hearty dinner.

Hearty dinner at least two, ideally three, hours before sleep.

Respect the bed. The bed is for naps and for sleep. Do not watch TV on the bed. Chatting is ok, but don’t fall asleep chatting. Respect sleep, keep boundaries. Read for 30mins, ideally one hour, before sleeping.

Having a Place of Work that can become impregnated with intention and routine is ideal.

Most important - take good care of the three essentials - sleep, food, exercise. A good day is marked by intentioned rest and wake, hearty food, strong and vigourous movement. Can’t stress this enough. Spend money on groceries. Spend money on buying food. Be smart about it but don’t be miserly. Put effort into packing food, finding food, making food. This effort more than enough pays for itself + makes me happy.

Find space for exercise. Beginning will always be hard, routine is hard. Persevere.

Find space for journalling and for sitting. Can feel like not important, not worth it. Almost always is. I know this in my deepest of minds and hearts.

Be formidable. Speak my mind. Display and embody competence. Be willing to go the extra mile, especially for other people’s benefit. Don’t shy away from conflict or confrontation, if what is at stake is important. Smile. Pause before speaking, try to establish a moment of genuine connection. Pet the cats. Go to the dog shelter. Make time and space every week to go somewhere new and explore. Bump into people, make small talk and big talk. Laugh. Be intense and able to kick back.

The world is waiting for you.

some of my favourite memories of my time as a berkeley undergraduate manifested my last year (senior year in Americanese) on tuesday evenings at la val’s pizza, right at the periphery of northside of campus, a stroll away from the hulking concrete-glass masses of soda and etchverry where silicon sorcerers and apprentices were busy at play. tuesday evenings had become ritualized hangs for the motley berkeley psychedelic science group (or psysci for short, in what was the kind of great coinage that seems obvious in hindsight), a ritual that had commenced at the start of fall by a group of 7 consciousness aficionados who went into the forested redwoods to Figure Things Out about how to go about running an ~official~, university sponsored, student psychedelic group, with tuesdays@7 being the primary realization made.

in the fantastic review of Sheila Liming’s book Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time, resonant observations are offered about how we, sapiens a sprint into the 2nd millennium, are forgetting how to Hang Out. unlike the tiresome albeit hitting-close-to-home narrative of young people losing their minds to phones, the subject here is all of us, not just the young un’s with their new fangled toys.

i write this at a cafe in tel aviv overlooking dizengoff square with its subdued fountains and pigeon-brimming palm trees. tel aviv is not a city you would accuse his denizens of not hanging out, indeed, the avivians don’t seem to do much else in the plethora of cafe-bars spilling out on the street, the white sand crystal blue beaches, and the dog and child filled parks and squares that dot the pulsing heart of israel. last night, while in pursuit of thai food, i stumbled upon a river of white and blue flags that lead to a sea of a massive rally. boisterous cries of de-mo-kra-cia reverberated across the thoroughfare, drummers vigorously rendered defiant beats attracting caravans of the young and the old, who added in an ensemble of trumpet-types, whistles, car horns and old-fashioned hoots and yells, in an orchestra of the human spirit’s unwillingness to be quiet.

the previous night i had been invited to a shabbat, my first, by a good friend’s friend’s roommate. expecting a solemn candlelit roundtable, perhaps with a wizened jewish man with a kippah and a great grey beard directing the proceedings, i was instead met with a young group of mostly americans, with a smattering of israelis and chileans for good measure, drinking wine and having a good time - essentially a wholesome version of your american house party. having being told this was a potluck, i had nabbed a bottle of wine (for a discount, as apparently the wine company had been racist a couple of years back and never been completely forgiven), an act that solidified the feeling of being an Adult, complete with the slight worry of not buying a wine that was Good Enough, aka expensive enough, and making sure to take the price tag off. i knew no one at the wholesome shabbat party, indeed, the person who invited me i had met half an hour prior, but there was no cause for angst, as i realized i was not alone. such shabbats, it turns out, typical have a three layer structure - the Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Periphery - with the lattermost being represented this time by me and a couple more people, visitors to this strange beautiful paradoxical country looking for community and to Hang Out.

tuesdays@7 in la vals, rallies to keep democracy alive, shabbats, spaces carved out of our schedules with no need to be fit on the google calendar, where the sometimes awkward, the sometimes effortful, brownian motion of people and worlds colliding and changing, however slightly or subtlety, our trajectories, leaving stories to be revived in future Hangs, the butterfly fission effect where past meets future through the interconnected mosaic of our lives with strangers and Inner Circle alike.

this is perhaps what i resent about LinkedIn culture the most. for all its utility as a tool for allowing one to connect with other people, and as a visitor on a mission to another country i do not take this utility lightly, the connections it brokers is one of utility itself. networking, working the room, ‘making’ connections - the peculiar activeness of the verb - gives me pause.

some of my favourite memories of my time as a berkeley undergraduate were on psysci tuesdays at la val’s pizza. these were also, by conventional terms, my most unproductive moments. hung out with the homies every week shooting the shit about consciousness and the nature of reality is not a line on my resume. it is, however, a line etched in the creases of my stories and the crevices of my being.

Digital homing pigeon released from Zuzulu Montenegro.


Ozzy gazing towards the skyline of Tel Aviv, feat my foot.

Chutzpah
(noun) supreme self-confidence : also nerve, gall, audacity, effrontery

from the Yiddish khutspe, from Late Hebrew ḥuṣpāh

Ten weeks in the Holy Land / Startup Nation (02022023 - 22042023)

Israel was a fitting first chapter in the dogyssey, filled with a growing sense of ground, assuredness, and clarity, with a sprinkle of za'atar and chutzpah. The tone was set within the first week with a friendly meeting with Assaf and Zvi, CTO and data scientist of SpotItEarly. Strolling in Tel Aviv’s vibrant Sarona Market, I listened to the remarkable progress in the early detection of cancer made by the intrepid crew of entrepreneurs, scientists, and labradors. Interim results from their large clinical trial found a 93% specificity and sensitivity in the detection of the four most common types of early and late stage cancers. A lab of labradors providing highly accurate, early stage, multi-purpose, inexpensive, and convenient disease screening no longer remains a pipe-dream, indeed, the future of furry dognostics is already here.

Emboldened by such happenings apaw, I set forth on my research sprint at the vibrant Tech4Animals (T4A) lab in the charming city of Haifa. Led by the laser-sharp Anna Zamansky, T4A has been developing rigorous and sophisticated machine vision models that can predict the physical and mental states of animals and thus, was a natural base for laying the foundations for deciphering the canine mind.

My primary order of business was a rigorous assessment of the canine EEG space to craft a foundational text to launch near-future research. Surprisingly, measuring the neural electrobiome of dogs has an ‘ancient’ history, with Adolf Beck recording from the canine brain 130 years ago. I read (lightly) over a 100 papers that deployed electrodes with dogs (and wolves!) and did deep dives into 22 papers that measured the EEG of domestic dogs without anaesthesia or piercing the skin. Close dissection of these studies, all within the past decade, revealed two key insights -

we can use relatively accessible and portable neuroimaging devices to make meaningful inferences on canine cognition

there is still a bunch of low-hanging fruit to chomp on in terms of improving hardware, data, and algorithms

Simultaneously, I fleshed out my technical and scientific know-how on acquiring, processing, and analysing EEG data — in general, enabled by an OpenBCI Ganglion and Muse 2, and for canines specifically, by cooking up pipelines and analysis frameworks for open-source and partner-shared data.1

The intangibles of Israel held as much gravity, if not more, than the concretes above. The leap of faith inherent in the independent pursuit of a lifetime project off-the-plodded path, the cracking of foreign cultural codes, the meeting with brilliant and kind people, the creation and refinement of goals, habits, and iterative feedback loops, and the two glorious sunny weeks in Tel Aviv hanging out with the amazingly life-filled Ozzy, these and more were all valuable gifts and blessings from the Holy land.

Three details that simply ask to be mentioned

Having committed to participating in Israel’s national neurotech hackathon, I found out the day before that my collaborator and her devoted service dog would not be making the event. Left canine-less, I instead joined forces with students from the BGU to work on an EEG hyperscanning neurofeedback game. Despite a certain team member’s mournful yearning for woofs, we ended up “winning”.

Wonderful people I met included Yossi Yovel of the BatLab and listening to plant screams fame, amazing people from Effective Altruism Israel, and a whole troop of eccentric folks at Purim, the Jewish carnival, in Jerusalem.

I had a world-changing experience eating the best falafel ever at Frishman, TLV.

Agency

“At critical moments in time, you can raise the aspirations of other people significantly, especially when they are relatively young, simply by suggesting they do something better or more ambitious than what they might have in mind. ”

Tyler Cowen, Marginal Revolution

Eight months post graduation steeping in India (01062022 - 31012023)

The lurching lull of quiet after an eventful spring graduation week followed by a home-bound landing to the sangeeth of my brother’s wedding allowed for the brewing of what was to come.

Emergent Ventures had been on my radar for a while and at the end of a month of mulling on what-is-life-after-college, I distilled my deepest resonances in a dream-vial of 1500 words.  Two weeks later while reading Aurobindo’s incisive writings on Nietzsche’s lurid madness in the Pondicherry Ashram, a shot of lightning brought the vial’s contents to life.

A month later, on the cusp of India’s independence day, I was in the same Udaipur hotel with a hundred incredibly talented, ambitious, and driven people, at the Emergent Ventures India Unconference. Talking with people of my generation building highly impactful, hundred people plus companies, doing sophisticated and meaningful research and journalism, and generally refusing to accept societal constraints on the realm of possibilities, completely recalibrated my notions of capability and infused me with radical notion of agency.

The next months were preparation of body, mind, and spirit and a growing realization for the need of a leap of faith towards what became a research odyssey.

“Berkeley, where cyberpunk meets psychedelic.”

“We already knew the solutions to many of the problems we now face. What we need to do is to simply relearn how to listen.” - what a time to be alive

2018 - 2022

I ended 2021 perched on the ledge of Doe library sensing a world bristling with a psychedelic cybernetic electricity. Cognitive Science at Cal is a smorgasbord of interdisciplinarity with an overriding resonance of encounter — of carbon meeting silicon, animal meeting symbol, history meshed with future — and being at the confluence of these streams led to an overwhelming sense of wanting to build bridges.

With the doors of perception slightly ajar, dogluk began to open their eyes, poodling around at the methods of entrepreneurship bootcamp, attempting lift-off with a catalyst grant, synthesising expansive models of cognition through an honors thesis, and landing a new beginning with an optimistic vision of the future.

When not admin-ing, fundraising, hiring, team-building and vision-ing, I’m on a constant quest of getting good enough in the multitude of domains and disciplines that leading dognosis R&D entails.

As of October 2024, this involves gaining fluency in computational neuroscience, full-stack development, data science, mechanical engineering, embedded and sensor systems, machine vision, clinical research operations, diagnostic regulations, oncology, health economics, biostatistics and volatile organic chemistry. To be comfortable in the language of each of the these domains feels essential in building a roadmap towards our vision and effectively leading our team.

This is hard.

Clearly, the goal cannot be to “get good” at each and every one of the fields. To truly do this in a single life-time feels impossible, unless perhaps you’re von Neumann, and while I may be slightly above the median in IQ, I am no genius.

A big challenge is that the fields in question often do not have much in the way of commonality. At 11am I am thinking about the optimal calculation of sample power size for a set PPV/NPV, at 12 on how we can convert 3D poly-models to b-reps, at 1 on the nuances of ISO 15189 and CLIA, at 2 on the use of graph neural networks to map relationships between EEG channels, at 3 on the modelling of molecules, odor receptor and percept interactions, and at 4 on designing novel stacks of companion diagnostics into standard-of-care. Don’t get me wrong - I absolutely love the variety - to bridge between silos and boundaries is what I intellectually relish the most. However, the lack of an underlying set of common principles to anchor and double-down on means there are often no easy compounding returns to accelerate learning across questions.

This access to generalizable first-principles to accelerate learning is vital because to be a founder of a startup means to be in constant pursuit of unfair leverage to move at speeds others cannot. If the success of dognosis cracking scents is constrained on my ability to learn the language of the needed disciplines, and this is bottlenecked by time x focus, leverage is in limited supply.

Except dognosis is not a one-dog show.

I need to constantly remind myself that my job is to get up to speed, to be just good enough in a discipline, that I can find as well as convince someone who is _very good_ to join. Then, I need to remain good enough to understand the best ways to work with them to orchestrate people and projects and processes that will get us towards our shared goals.

The best leverage ultimately lies in the emergent, difficult to predict, easy to underestimate, often challenging, and sometimes magical ability of interdisciplinary (and interspecies) teams to hold capabilities that are far greater, often exponentially so, than the sum of their individual abilities.

I just reread Paul Graham’s 2022 [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html) on writing (Putting Ideas Into Words). Here’s a couple of the money lines -

“no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it.”

“Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be right. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it is a necessary one.”

This is one of my favourite PG essays.  It articulates what I’ve long felt about writing - why I find it so valuable and why I often find it so hard to do. It hits home harder in an age of AI promising/threatening to do all our writing (and therefore thinking).

For me, the point of writing doesn’t lie in the transfer of information, persuasion, or the construction of a personal brand (shudder). It instead lies in the sometimes magical, sometimes frustrating, always iterative refinement of ideas and identity.

PG’s essay doesn’t touch on two other reasons I find writing so meaningful.

The first is the simple fact that writing can be deeply joyous, when the words come out in a [crackling flow of electricity](https://visakanv.substack.com/p/branching-paths). This doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it leaves an afterglow of what I can only describe as writer’s high. Such pieces also tend to be the best, they sing with verve and humour, and often feel effortless to write. /0/ felt like that.

The second, and most compelling reason I write is the ability to reflexively surf what I like to call the experience-expectation (xp) loop.  I’ve described this before in [cosmic birthday gift](https://runsandtumbles.substack.com/p/cosmic-birthday-gift). I’ve found surfing the xp loop to be one of the deepest sources of resonance and meaning. This is where writing can truly transcend the ‘mere’ refinement of thought and become something far more powerful. There’s a lot more to explore here and I know I’ve only scratched the surface. [Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/) has written some [potent stuff](https://www.amazon.com/High-Weirdness-Esoterica-Visionary-Experience/dp/1907222871) if you’d like a more experienced guide (see his book High Weirdness that delves into the writing of authors such as Phillip K Dick).

Anyways, not to jinx it but I’ve really been enjoying the little writing streak I’ve gotten going this week. I’ve been meaning to do this for a while, simply committing to writing something everyday, but it somehow never got over the initial activation threshold. Now that I’ve got a spark, I’m hopeful I can keep it burning.

Keep the dragon energy alive,

Akash

some research suggests that the sapien prefrontal cortex only really matures around the age of 25.

in other words, to be fully forged as a whole-grown adult, you must live for a quarter of a century.

I have almost managed to attain this wholly unremarkable feat as i turn 25 on jan 21. and while i cannot make claims of cortical maturation, this past year does feel like i am all grown up…

i worked my first real job that paid a salary (thanks dognosis!)

i learned to drive a car in peak bengaluru traffic on the regular and picked and dropped family and friends to the airport

i hit and got hit by multiple vehicles while driving a car. i learned how bangalore police stations work and that the law and justice are fictions, useful fictions but mere stories we collectively agree to believe in nevertheless

i learned that salads are actually great (thanks itamar) and ordered them at restaurants as something to genuinely look forward to

i went from only taking full responsibility for myself to meaningful responsibility for 30 other wonderful beings. this meant i went from someone who often would drop off all comms and head into the woods for his bday without telling anyone to being responsive within 24hrs. I was on the ball 12hrs a day 6 (often 7) days a week, almost every week (9/10)

I used to crumple into a ball when sick but fought off a viral to take investor calls till midnight and then woke at 7 to power wash shit off kennel floors bc our caretaker and trainers all got hit w life and someone had to fucking do it. I remember taking off my shirt and the sun hitting me and feeling like a fucking man as dog shit blasted off the floor

I carried a poor dying rabid street puppy by the name of carbon to the hospital as he whimpered his last. i felt my resolve supernova, birthing steel glittered nebula, molecules of agency coalescing to form something that the llms still lack - a quest of gravity-bending purpose. I made sure all our team and the friendly drone making neighbours got their rabies shots. i learned how a literal zombie virus lives amongst us and takes our best every year in thousand droves. i learned that sometimes there is no one to blame for the world’s evils, that often times evil is simply an inability or an inertia towards inhabiting the throbbing vastness of true empathy. i learned that building bridges, as well as fences, to allow life to more fully, more selflessly, live in this empathic wilderness, is as close to wrestling with god, perhaps even closer, as any kind of cave dwelling retreat or pilgrimical dip in a river.

i realized how truly attuned i felt to my life-purpose. how the protostars of dognosis and soulmates and pratibha poshak weaved together a trajectory that feels too good to be anything but true. that i suddenly no longer could be teenagerly nonchalant about death, that i had faint embers of fear on some flights that i could rationally brush off but nonetheless flickered. that the world teetering on a precipice was no longer an abstraction to chew on casually, that there were real stakes - personal stakes - of wanting to be on the cosmic ride for longer.

i discovered that love is truly ineffable and that it is impenetrable and unplumbable by the discursive intellect. i began to understand what this means, “an understanding that love is not an act of possession but rather one of play. the game? to expand the boundaries of one’s goodness in the face of absolute and unequivocal loss. it’s hopeless, after all. So how far can you go?”.

i didn’t run, cook, write, sit, read, or love as much as i’d liked to. i’m glad i get another go around the sun to do so.

the most effective way I stop myself from snoozing, a real problem given my subconscious’ impressive snooze auto-pilot, is to simply place the phone in a position that forces me to get out of bed. even better if it’s close to the curtains so that I can yank them open, ensuring my circadian rhythm finds its footing with daylight. the least effective way is to berate my lack of discipline/willpower.

the best way I’ve found to be able to remember to deal with the barrage of founder tasks is to let them go – safely into the embrace of a to-do list. off-loading from my fickle carbon RAM to trusty silicon not only grants reliability, it frees precious neural estate for things that matter more and i actually relish - creative riffing, strategic problem-solving and tactical riposte. post-its too, do not underestimate the power of a stack of post-its and a pen near the shower.

i turned off notifications for every app on my phone except mygate. [no social apps](https://www.tumbles.run/p/deleting-the-apps-for-the-nth-time) feature on my homescreen, i must type them out to enter their supersensoriums.

i just bought a 2l water bottle to replace my 750ml one. i have multiple laptop chargers, one at every desk i work at, but none at the bedside table. my workout clothes always hang on a hook on my bedroom door. my running shoes have socks already in them. our kitchen is semi-optimized for protein smoothies. i keep a meditation cushion next to my bed that i can’t help but look at it everyday and scatter books around like grain, near the toilet, bedside, coffee table, shelves.

the jury is out on how much the latter two have really helped, sitting and reading have yet to turn the tide against scrolling, even despite the dearth of apps. the brain finds a way to hunt down its dopamine, even if it entails substack, slack, or email. but in the epic battle of the individual against the legion of highly skilled engineers tuning sophisticated algorithms that fire-hose you with the world’s happenings, you take what wins you can get.

Dogs as deep tech

Agreement on the definition of deep-tech may not yet be consensus, but a useful definition nevertheless exists — technology that enables radically new capabilities for humanity and a step-change in the possibility-space for our species.

One such step-change - the co-domestication of another species leading to a wholly unique melding of minds, where cognitive abilities of differentially embodied intelligent agents begin to act in unison, where each species evolves to possess new capacities for action in physical and social worlds.

The proto-typical example of which definitively changed the arc of two species that came to dominate Earth in the Second Millennium.

A technological process whose precise origin is still hotly contested but is generally understood to have been underway more than [11,000 years ago](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aba9572), well before the end of the Holocene and the dawn of the Neolithic, when sapiens sprung forward past the glacier melt into history as we know it.

Domestication pre-dated agriculture, which preceded – and indeed, was the necessary precursor to – the industrial, informational, and intelligence ages. Arguably, domestication was itself a necessary step before agriculture, the crucial domino that needed to fall before humanity would be able to raise sentience from sand a few thousand years later.

>"Remove domestication from the human species, and there’s probably a couple of million of us on the planet, max. Instead, what do we have? Seven billion people, climate change, travel, >innovation and everything. Domestication has influenced the entire earth. And dogs were the first.”
>Greger Larson, archaeologist and geneticist [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/the-origin-of-dogs/484976/)

And dogs were the first.

Or at least, the wolf-like ancestor that would become the dog. A fellow apex predator, living in highly social and complex packs that were capable of impressive feats of collective intelligence, that betted on being better off with four legs on the ground, a tail, and befriending the fearsome monkeys with the fire-summoning powers.

The canids gained a powerful ally — an advanced simian possessing state-of-the-art weaponry, significant physical endurance, and sophisticated tribal intelligence.

The sapiens, on the other hand, would have been equally pleased with their side of the bargain. The proto-dog was a hunting partner with a fierce set of fangs in a 40 kilo muscle-suit, yes, but they were also much more: the two most consequential aspects being - a nocturnal sentinel network that allowed for deeper REM cycles and an olfactory sense-making system granting access to a far richer Umwelt. Both carried weight of immediate practical import.

And so, a partnership was natural, a symbiosis if you will, an inter-mammalian entanglement of monumental consequence.

>Walking beside us, canis familiaris was close witness to the major eras of human history - agriculture, the domestication >of livestock, the wheel, writing, paper, and the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, and the internet, and of >course, artificial intelligence.
>[Uncannis Familiaris](https://www.tumbles.run/p/uncannis-familiaris), A Dognosis Manifesto

The proto-dog is one of humanity’s most primal technologies, arguably fourth behind only fire, shelter, and clothing. Just as the former three have undergone technological evolution – with current frontier forms taking the shape of nuclear fusion, skyscrapers, and space-suits – the proto-dog too has morphed too, the apex of which could be said to be the para-trooping Belgian Malinois.

Or have they? Such is only really true for a pawful of cases. The vast majority of canines today live with their humans in much the same way that they did hundreds, or even thousands, of years ago. The leash may be nylon rather than hide-skin and we may have tastier treats, but nothing fundamental has changed. Indeed, most of the dogs and humans of past eras arguably accomplished more impressive feats together more often than they do today. We have arguably regressed, rather than progressed. Witness the pitiful pug gasping for air from a nose engineered to be cute rather than functional.

But the few exceptions are nevertheless illuminating. A special ops Belgian Malinois can indeed [paratroop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg198ixDfw4) out of a moving helicopter, and hit the ground running (relatively), triangulating traces of explosive and weapons by his nose that are invisible to the best radar. A mixed-breed dog riding in a speedboat can sniff out the [smell of killer whale scat](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/meet-eba-a-dog-whose-job-is-to-sniffs-out-whale-poop/) floating in the vast Pacific. A [biomedical detection Labrador](http://medicaldetectiondogs.org.uk/) is capable of sniffing from a few milliliters of urine the difference between a low and a high Gleeson score of prostate cancer, a stupendous feat that cannot be replicated by any machine today.

All three dogs above display an olfactory wizardry that continues to grant us unmatched access to the world of scent. Remarkably, what was true of the proto-dog, remains true all these many technology branches later. We have not cracked the olfactory code but we can sniff it, through an uncanny yet familiar interspecies alliance. And while the periodic [breathless article](https://www.wired.com/1998/05/the-electronic-nose-knows) reports on the e-nose being close to taking the sniffing crown, the canine nose remains the top dog, on the battlefield, at the airport, and in the lab.

In many ways, dogs are one of humanity’s oldest R&D project. They are also our deepest - a technological step-change that provided humanity a multi-use platform with olfactory capabiltiies that we still cannot best today. For 11,000 years and counting we’ve had access to superhuman capabilities, but we’ve been restricted by a primitive interface - food and a handful of monosyllables. It's time to take the synaesthetic symbiosis that we've been honing for millennia and unleash the superpowers hiding in furry sight.
