A collection of moments, places, and perspectives captured through my lens.

## Photography Philosophy

I'm drawn to authentic moments and the beauty in everyday scenes. Whether it's street photography, portraits, or landscapes, I try to capture something genuine - a feeling, a story, or just an interesting play of light.
