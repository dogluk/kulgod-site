Official-y Bio

Akash Kulgod is a cognitive scientist and the co-founder of Dognosis. He leads R&D efforts to develop wearable brain-computer interfaces and neurobehavioral machine learning models for dogs, with the primary goal of creating neuroAI olfactory models capable of disease screening at scale. He grew up in a family of 11 doctors in Belgaum, India, before studying Cognitive Science with Highest Honors at UC Berkeley. His thesis on a novel 4E cognitive model of canine olfaction won the Robert J. Glushko Prize for Distinguished Undergraduate Research, and he was the Berkeley Cognitive Science 2022 commencement speaker.Â  He has been a visiting researcher at Tech4Animals, Israel; Family Dog Project, Budapest; and Medical Detection Dogs, UK and is the first author of multiple publications, posters, and patents on canine cognitive neuroscience, early cancer detection, and bio-inspired olfaction. He is a 2x Emergent Ventures India grantee and a 2025 Foresight Institute Neurotechnology Fellow. He lives in Bangalore where he spends most of the time with the Dognosis Pack at the R&D HQ and Lab.

Fun-y Bio

Akash was the kind of person who would try his hardest to come up with a quirky bio to make it clear he was not a normie, before he realized profesionnal bios are instrumental tools to achieve the pragmatic goals necessary to achieve a sci-fi uplift future. He is technically Irish (the accent does not give it away) despite not being born in Ireland or having any Irish heritage, though his fondness for U2 arguably makes up for it. He will probably try to bring up how the 4 different cities across 3 continents he has spend considerable time in start with "Be". It is possible he may bring up his experience being the Co-President of the Psychedelic Science at Berkeley club - PsySci, where he co-facilitated the for-credit course Introduction to Psychedelic Science. It is not outside the realm of possibility that his fondness for the outdoors, although having taken a backseat of late, will shine through in conversation, where he may try to slip-in his solo camping escapade in the Ventura Wilderness, or his epic adventures around the Annapurna mountains. It may also be revealed that he has a terrible sense of smell which adds ironic fuel to the mission, and that he really really likes dogs (and he hopes they like him back).
