Hi, I'm Dogluk.

I'm a writer, photographer, and creative based in [Your Location]. This is my space on the internet where I share my thoughts through writing, capture moments through photography, and connect with others who appreciate the art of storytelling.

## What I Do

**Writing** - I explore ideas through words, whether it's personal essays, creative pieces, or thoughts on life, technology, and culture. You can find my regular writing on [Substack](your-substack-link) and here on this site.

**Photography** - I believe in the power of visual storytelling. My photos capture everyday moments, travels, and the beauty I find in the ordinary.

**Creating** - Always working on something new, whether it's a writing project, a photo series, or experimenting with different forms of creative expression.

## Connect With Me

## This Site

This website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It's my digital home where I share longer-form writing, photography, and thoughts that need more space than social media allows.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to reach out if something resonates with you.
