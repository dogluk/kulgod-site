This is where I share my thoughts, stories, and explorations through writing.

## Newsletter

I write regularly on **[Substack](your-substack-link)** where I share weekly thoughts on creativity, technology, life, and whatever else is on my mind. It's more personal and conversational than what you'll find here.

## Writing Philosophy

I believe in writing that's honest, accessible, and human. Whether I'm exploring complex ideas or sharing personal stories, my goal is to create something that resonates and maybe helps us understand ourselves and our world a little better.
