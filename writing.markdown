"
For me, the point of writing doesn’t lie in the transfer of information, persuasion, or the construction of a personal brand (shudder). It instead lies in the sometimes magical, sometimes frustrating, always iterative refinement of ideas and identity. 

PG’s [essay](https://www.paulgraham.com/words.html) doesn’t touch on two other reasons I find writing so meaningful. 

The first is the simple fact that writing can be deeply joyous, when the words come out in a crackling flow of electricity. This doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it leaves an afterglow of what I can only describe as writer’s high. Such writing also tend to be the best, the words sing with verve and humour, and often feel effortless to write. 

The second, and most compelling reason I write is the ability to reflexively surf what I like to call the experience-expectation (xp) loop.
